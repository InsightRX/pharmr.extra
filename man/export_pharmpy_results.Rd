\title{Export a pharmpy model object}
\usage{
export_pharmpy_results(results, file)
}
\arguments{
\item{results}{Pharmpy results object to save}

\item{file}{JSON file to save to}
}
\description{
Currently, pharmr/pharmpy is not able to export results objects from grid
searches or model fits. This function aims to work around that until it does.
It essentially saves the model information separately, and upon reloading
it reconstructs the models in the results object.
}
\details{
The saved object is not a Pharmpy object, but it has most of the same
entries so can be used as a drop-in.
}
