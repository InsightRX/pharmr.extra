\usage{
get_compartment_scale(model, compartment = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{pharmpy model object or NONMEM model code (character) or path
to NONMEM model file.}

\item{compartment}{compartment number. If \code{NULL} will be attempted to
infer from ADVAN. If not a default ADVAN is used, will use 1 as default. So
for safe use, please always specify the observation compartment to be scaled.}
}
\value{
a list with elements \code{variable} and \code{scale}, e.g.
}
\description{
Assumes scale is always defined either as a single variable
(e.g. \code{S2 = V2}), or as a variable divided by a factor (e.g.
\code{S2 = V2/1000}. Other expressions will very likely not result
in a correct extraction, or errors.
