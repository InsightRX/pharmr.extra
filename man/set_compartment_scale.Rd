\title{Set scaling for certain compartments, e.g. dose and observation
compartments.}
\usage{
set_compartment_scale(
  model,
  compartment = NULL,
  expression = list(variable = "V", scale = 1000),
  update_inits = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{pharmpy model object or NONMEM model code (character) or path
to NONMEM model file.}

\item{compartment}{compartment number. If \code{NULL} will be attempted to
infer from ADVAN. If not a default ADVAN is used, will use 1 as default. So
for safe use, please always specify the observation compartment to be scaled.}

\item{expression}{specification of new scaling, should always contain variable
and scale arguments. E.g. \code{list(variable = "V", "scale" = 1000)}.}

\item{update_inits}{update initial estimates for basic PK parameters? This is
likely needed when applying scale, or else it is very likely that the model
starts too far off from the maximum likelihood and the fit will not
converge properly. \code{TRUE} by default.}

\item{verbose}{verbose output?}
}
\value{
Pharmpy model
}
\description{
Currently not available in Pharmpy, this is a workaround function.
