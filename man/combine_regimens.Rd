\description{
Combine several regimens into a single data.frame, which can be passed into
\code{luna::run_sim()} as \code{regimen} argument.
}
\details{
This allows both for combination of two or more phases, e.g. loading doses
and maintenance phase in a single regimen. It also allows for specification
of multiple separate regimens to simulate, e.g. a high-dose regimen and a
low-dose regimen.
