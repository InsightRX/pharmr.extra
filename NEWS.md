# pharmr.extra (development version)

* `run_nlme()`, `run_sim()`, and `create_vpc_data()` now dispatch on the model
  engine. Pharmpy nlmixr-format models are routed through nlmixr2 / rxode2
  directly (no pharmpy `pyreadr` dependency). NONMEM models still use the
  existing nmfe / PsN / pharmpy paths unchanged.
* New `control` argument on `run_nlme()` is forwarded to
  `nlmixr2::nlmixr2()` (e.g. `foceiControl()`); ignored for NONMEM.
* `validate_model()` now accepts nlmixr-format pharmpy models.
* `get_advan()` / `get_obs_compartment()` return gracefully for non-NONMEM
  models instead of erroring on the missing control stream.

* Initial CRAN submission.
